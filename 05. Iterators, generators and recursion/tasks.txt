# 1. Create a program that will receive a number and print the corresponding number in the Fibonacci list using
#    generators

# 2. Create a program that will accept a number and print the corresponding number in the Fibonacci sequence using
#    iterators

# 3. Create a program that will accept a number and print the corresponding number in the Fibonacci sequence using
#    recursion

# 4. Write a program that will return the factorial of the entered
#    number using recursion



Example: when entering 3 - output 2, when entering 6 - output 8, when entering 9 - output 34.
